description: A bit of an introduction
---

My name is Alejandro Piad. I'm a Computer Scientist from Havana, Cuba.
I work as instructor (entry-level professor) and researcher at the
[School of Math and Computer Science](http://www.matcom.uh.cu),
[University of Havana](http://www.uh.cu).

My research interests include machine learning (shallow and deep),
natural language processing, automatic knowledge discovery,
formal languages and metaheuristics.
It's kind of a mess but it does let me try different cross-domain ideas.

Currently I'm teaching _Programming_ to first year university students
(practical lessons), and _Compilers & Formal Languages_ to third year
students (main lecturer). I'm also in the middle of a joint PhD program,
between the University of Havana and the University of Alicante,
where I do research mostly about [deep learning applied to knowledge discovery](https://github.com/knowledge-learning).

In my free time I also enjoy coding, playing video games (althought not that much lately),
and writing. I write that interests me, just for the fun of sharing it.
This can be anything from [cool stuff I found out how to do](/programming) (read: code),
[interesting research](/research) that I've read somewhere, or just random ramblings.
I sometimes blog about pretty technical stuff mainly for students or colleagues
of mine that have very similar interests.
Recently I've been coding a lot in Python, and have a couple
[FOSS projects on Github](https://github.com/apiad)
that might (or not) be interesting for some. I also [blog about these](/projects) from time to time.

I recently quit Facebook (yeah!) but I'm sometimes online on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AlejandroPiad),
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/apiad) (though I don't update it very much) and
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/apiad).

I believe that people are generally good, and if given the chance, they will show the
better parts of themselves. I'm dedicated to education, because I think that access to
high-quality, unbiased, and free education is one of the best gifts for anyone,
and of the easiest ways to make people more reasonable and tolerant.
I've been lucky to receive great education from a lot of awesome teachers, to whom
I'll be forever grateful.
For these reasons, I share what I know for free, in the hopes someone can find it useful.

I also believe people should have the chance to speak their minds, without being afraid
to being silenced, or hated for it, even if they are wrong.
And they should have the option to recognize their mistakes, learn from them, and be forgiven.
However, I do not tolerate racism or discrimination of any kind, and work very hard to apply
those same standards to my own behavior.

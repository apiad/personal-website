At this moment I'm focused mostly on machine learning, specifically in the natural language comprehension sub-field.
I'm currently doing a Ph.D. in a joint project between my Alma Mater, University of Havana, and the University of Alicante.
The main topics of this Ph.D. involve the design of a natural language annotation schema that captures the semantic meaning of sentences, and the development of corpora to train machine learning techniques that automatically extract this representation.

The most recent publications about this topic are:

* [A corpus to support eHealth Knowledge Discovery technologies](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103172)
* [Analysis of eHealth knowledge discovery systems in the TASS 2018 workshop](http://journal.sepln.org/sepln/ojs/ojs/index.php/pln/article/view/5947)
* [Overview of TASS 2018: Opinions, Health and Emotions](http://rua.ua.es/dspace/handle/10045/81394)
* [Gathering object interactions as semantic knowledge](https://search.proquest.com/openview/5938022ad52e338c5f986d5598a30055/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=1976349)

I'm also interested in the development of AutoML (Automatic Machine Learning) techniques that scale with problem complexity. I still don't have published results on this topic, but I'm working on some interesting stuff that I plan to publish soon.
